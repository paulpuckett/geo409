#Map Assignment 5: Creating a personal portfolio website

Follow the process described in Module 16 to create your own portfolio site, hosted on GitHub Pages (consult with the course instructors if you already have a web host and would prefer to use it).

Your portfolio page should contain and link to at minimum 4 project entries: 3 maps you have already created for this course and 1 "in-progress" map which will be your final map project.

You will need to generate and link to your own screenshots of your maps for use within the portfolio page.

While you are free to use the example HTML structure and CSS rules for the layout of your web page and positioning of elements ([http://newmapsplus.github.io/geo409-709/](http://newmapsplus.github.io/geo409-709/), you are encouraged to personalize the page (it is part of the grading) with the following:
* choice of typefaces
* choice of colors

Submit a URL link to your online portfolio (e.g., http://*username*.github.io) to Canvas by **11am on Thursday, April 16th**.
